# Week-19---React
Employee Directory 

## Description 

In this app the intention is to be able to sort Employee data by typical data types and sort those types by a specific category.  The user can also search by names and the returned responses are filtered by the user input.  This app uses a random user api to return info, however it could be adapted to be used with other information data bases.
